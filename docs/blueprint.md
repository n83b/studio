# **App Name**: Transistor Rhythms

## Core Features:

- Kit Selection: Kit Selection: Choose from a curated list of 808-inspired drum kits. Each kit contains sounds for kick, snare, hat, and additional percussive elements.
- Step Sequencer: Step Sequencer: A classic 16-step sequencer interface, where each step represents a beat. Activate or deactivate individual steps for each drum sound to create rhythm patterns.
- Tempo Control: Tempo Control: Adjust the tempo (beats per minute or BPM) to control the overall speed of the rhythm. This should have a clearly readable numeric indicator.
- Volume Mixer: Volume Mixer:  Individual volume controls (faders or knobs) for each drum sound, enabling precise control over the mix. Numeric indicator included.
- Pattern Triggering: Pattern Triggering: Buttons to control Start, Stop, and Clear, to manage the output of the rhythm pattern.
- Rhythm Randomizer: Rhythm Randomizer: A tool which, on activation, causes the AI to add variation to an existing beat pattern.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vivid, slightly desaturated red (#D64933) to represent the warm, analog character of the 808.  
- Background color: A near-black dark grey (#222021) that recedes to put focus on the UI elements.
- Accent color: A vibrant, light, orange color (#E8A87C) that provides contrast to the primary color. It is used for highlighting active steps and interactive elements in the sequencer.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for both headlines and UI labels. The technical nature of this font suggests the nature of a machine. Use all-caps.
